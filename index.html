      <h2 id="top1">1. Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew (2005)</h2>
      <img src="imgs/top1.png" alt="Pokemon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew" width="400">
      <p>While attending a festival honoring the knight, Sir Aaron, Ash releases Aaron's Lucario from his staff. Lucario explains that Aaron was the one who trapped him, bringing up doubts about Aaron's honor. Meanwhile, a Mew abducts Pikachu and Team Rocket's Meowth and takes them to its hidden home, prompting Ash and Lucario to team up and rescue them. While many Pokemon movies are relegated to only be worthwhile to fans of the franchise, <strong>Lucario and the Mystery of Mew </strong> is one of the very few that definitively stand on its own high-quality merits.</p>

      <h2 id="top2">2.Pokémon: Detective Pikachu (2019)</h2>
      <img src="imgs/top2.png" alt="Pokemon: Dectective Pikachu" width="400">
      <p>Former Pokémon trainer Tim Goodman learns that his estranged father, who works as a police officer in Ryme City, is presumed dead. While going to his dad's apartment, Tim meets his Pikachu partner, whom Tim can somehow understand. Pikachu thinks Tim's dad is still alive and asks Tim to help investigate his mission and a dangerous chemical that makes Pokémon feral. Being a live-action studio production, the film is clearly different than every other Pokémon movie, yet different clearly doesn't mean bad, as the changes were massively beloved by fans and general audiences alike.</p>

Deep in the jungle, a Zarude discovers a human baby and leaves his troupe to search for his parents. When he can't find them, he decides to raise the human as his son and names him Koko. Ten years later, Koko meets Ash and becomes conflicted about his identity as a human raised by a Pokémon while an evil scientist tries to harness the jungle's secret.</p>
